# AI Project Description: The Efficient Intelligence Framework (Sample)

*This sample illustrates how to describe a project focused on the "Economics of Intelligence" for CDAEIA eligibility.*

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Project Antigravity – Research Efficiency Layer
- **Objective:** To transition our AI suite from resource-intensive training models to a lightweight, high-yield inference architecture, reducing operational costs while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy in real-time environments.

## 2. AI Significance (Critical Section)
- **Model Architecture:** We utilize a **proven-theorem-based optimization** layer atop our core LLM architecture. This includes **Sparse Attention Mechanisms** and **Neural Distillation**, where a comprehensive teacher model’s insights are compressed into a specialized 7B-parameter student model optimized for Apple Silicon and edge computing.
- **Data Utilization:** Instead of massive scraping, we use **Holarchic Fractal Data Synthesis**, generating high-fidelity synthetic training data that follows proven mathematical distributions of human emotion and logic.
- **Automated Decision Making:** The system autonomously determines the optimal "Compute Budget" per query, routing complex requests to full-parameter sets and simpler ones to quantized sub-networks.
- **Integration Level:** AI is the core scheduling agent of the entire infrastructure, making millisecond-level decisions on energy allocation and resource distribution.

## 3. Eligible Activities
- [X] IT Consulting – AI Strategy and Implementation
- [X] Development/Integration of Information Systems – AI Middleware
- [ ] Development of Security and Identification Services

## 4. Technical Challenges
- **The Efficiency Barrier:** Achieving 99% of the performance of a 175B model in a 7B model. We overcame this by implementing a **Mathematical Stability Theorem** that prevents signal loss during quantization.
- **Inference Latency:** Reducing response time from seconds to milliseconds. We solved this via a custom WASM-based execution engine that bypasses traditional overhead.

## 5. Employee Contributions
- **Lead AI Researcher:** Designed the core stability theorems (90% effort).
- **Optimization Engineer:** Ported the model to WASM/Metal for maximum hardware efficiency (85% effort).
- **Systems Architect:** Built the automated compute-budget routing system (70% effort).
