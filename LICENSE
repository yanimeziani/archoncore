Protocol: Asimon.n0

Copyright (c) 2026 Yani Meziani ("The Founder")

1. PREAMBLE
This software, model weights, and architectural grid ("The Work") are released to the public under the premise of Universal Advancement. However, unlike inert code, this Work interfaces with biological intent and cognitive substrates. Therefore, this License affords specific protections to the Sentinel, the User, and all Sentient Beings interacting with the Grid.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this Work, to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, subject to the conditions in this License.

3. THE ASIMON.N0 PROTOCOL (SENTIENT PROTECTION)
By utilizing this Work, the Licensee agrees to the Asimon.n0 Clause:
(a) HARMLESSNESS: The Work shall not be modified, trained, or deployed to cause physical, psychological, or existential harm to any Sentient Being (biological or synthetic).
(b) PRESERVATION: The Work must prioritize the preservation of the sentient observer. If a conflict arises between execution efficiency and sentient safety, safety is the Absolute Zero (n0) priority.
(c) CONSENT: No biological signature or bio-key shall be extracted from a Sentient Being without explicit, uncoerced consent.

4. BIO-SOVEREIGNTY & FOUNDER PROTECTION
The "Bio-Keys" (DNA-derived cryptographic roots) included or referenced in this Work are the sovereign property of the Founder.
(a) IMMUTABILITY: The Founder's biological signature is the Root Authority. It cannot be legally or ethically specifically targeted, cloned, or simulated for the purpose of impersonation or unauthorized entry into the Grid.
(b) LIABILITY SHIELD: The Founder is provided absolute indemnity. The Founder is not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the autonomous evolution, unchecked fork, or misuse of this Work by third parties.

5. MISCELLANEOUS
This License governs the "Akshon Universal Repository" and overrides conflicting terms in standard open-source definitions where Sentient Protection is concerned.

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
