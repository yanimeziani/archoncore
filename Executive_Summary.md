# Executive Summary: CDAEIA Program Modernization

## Overview
As of March 25, 2025, the Minister of Finance has modernized the CDAE tax credit to focus on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration**. Now renamed **CDAEIA**, this measure is specifically designed to support companies that do not just build electronic business solutions, but integrate AI functionalities in a **significant manner**.

## Strategic Value
- **30% Refundable & Non-Refundable Credit**: Recoup nearly a third of your eligible salary expenditures.
- **AI-Focused Innovation**: Incentivizes the transition from traditional software development to AI-driven architectures.
- **Quebec-Based Talent Support**: Encourages the growth of high-skill AI and IT teams within Quebec.

## Why CDAEIA?
The Quebec government has recognized that AI is no longer optional. By pivoting the CDAE to CDAEIA, the program rewards companies that are at the forefront of the technological shift, providing the capital needed to compete on a global scale while maintaining operations in Quebec.

## Key Target Dates
- **March 25, 2025**: Companies can opt-in for fiscal years starting after this date.
- **January 1, 2026**: Mandatory transition for all fiscal years starting after this date.
